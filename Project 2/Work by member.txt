Karthik:
    initial knn algorithm
    created paper outline
Jonathan:
    Created method to take stratified samples
    Made Edited nearest neighbor method
    Made KNN that worked with the stratified samples
    Made K-means clusters
    Created kernel functions and classification and regression methods
    Created methods to tune all hyper-parameters
    Optimized and tuned the runtime of all functions

    Put results in paper
    Updated outline to better fit our experiments
    Provided result analysis and summary
    made sure each algorithm properly described

    Since wrote most of code created script for video
    Since need to alternate person to record video also recorded the video and edited it
